## mathematical formula
*vector dot product*
$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |a| |b| \cos(\theta)
$$
- [x] **a** and **b** are the vectors.
- [x] **|a|** and **|b|** are the magnitudes of the vectors.
- [x]**Î¸** is the angle between the two vectors.
> dot product can be used to find angle between vectors.
> [!NOTE]  
> check angles carefully and vector directions.

## code snippet
```python
import numpy as np

def dot_product(a, b):
    return np.dot(a, b)

# Example vectors
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Calculate dot product
print(dot_product(a, b))
```
